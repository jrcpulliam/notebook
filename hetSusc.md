title: Heterogeneous susceptibility
---

## Intro

Thinking about how to model hazard in a population with heterogeneous
susceptibility. Strongly related to the work done specifically for moth
viruses, and specifically for the gamma distribution, at \[\[gamma
speculations\]\]. Note that the "Approximation" section makes an
approximation that is exactly equivalent to assuming gamma
distributions.

### Links

-   \[\[Generalized exponential\]\] shows that this works perfectly for
    gammas, but worse than expected for other distributions. I think.
-   \[\[Heterogeneous susceptibility simulations\]\] seems to have
    nothing good.

## Framework

Imagine a population of "surviving" individuals, with heterogeneous
susceptibility distribution $$N(s)$$ that is exposed to a force of
infection $$f(t)$$ such that an individual with susceptibility $$s$$
experiences hazard $$s f(t)$$.

## Definitions

$$N_k \equiv \int{s^k N(s)\,ds}$$. Thus, $$N \equiv N_0$$ is the size of
the surviving population. $$N_1$$ would be the total amount of
susceptibility, which is awkward, and inspires our next set of moments:

$$s_k \equiv N_k/N$$. Thus, $$\bar s \equiv s_1$$ is the mean
susceptibility in the surviving population. $$s_2$$ is
$$\bar s^2 + \sigma_s^2$$, which is awkward, and inspires the
definition:

$$\kappa \equiv s_2/\bar s^2 - 1$$. $$\kappa$$ is the squared
coefficient of variation of susceptibility in the surviving population.

$$F \equiv \int{f(t)\,dt}$$ is the cumulative force of infection
experienced.

## Dynamics

The distribution of surviving individuals will obey the "master
equation":

$$\frac{dN(s)}{dF} = -sN(s)$$.

Integrating over $$s$$ gives:

$$\frac{dN}{dF} = -sN(s)$$ $$= -N_1$$ $$=-\bar s N$$, which is nice and
makes sense: the instantaneous change in the number of survivors is
predicted by the ''mean'' susceptibility.

The cool part is that we can multiply the master equation by $$s^k$$ and
get a chain of moment equations:

$$\frac{s^k dN(s)}{dF} = -s^{k+1}N(s)$$, and integrating gives

$$\frac{dN_k}{dF} = -N_{k+1}$$ $$=-s_{k+1} N$$.

In particular, when $$k=1$$, we can calculate how the mean
susceptibility changes:

$$\frac{dN_1}{dF} = -s_2 N$$.

Using the quotient rule:

$$\frac{d\bar s}{dF} = -s_2 + \bar s^2 = -\kappa\bar s^2$$.

We could continue the moment chain, but we will stop here by making an
approximation. We assume that the unitless squared CV $$\kappa$$ remains
constant (this will be exactly true if $$N(s)$$ is gamma distributed).

## Approximation

### How susceptibility changes

Using the approximation of constant $$\kappa$$, we can solve the
dynamics of $$\bar s$$:

$$\bar s = \frac{s_0}{1+\kappa Fs_0}$$. We can also set $$s_0$$ to 1, by
calibrating $$F$$ to be equivalent to the mean hazard for the starting
population. Then

$$\bar s = \frac{1}{1+\kappa F}$$.

### Survival

The proportion surviving follows:

$$\frac{dN}{dF} = -\bar s N = \frac{N}{1+\kappa F}$$,

which is solved by what I call the \[\[generalized exponential\]\]:

$$N/N_0 = (1+\kappa F)^{-1/\kappa} \equiv X(F; \kappa)$$

### Susceptibility vs. survival

What is the relationship between mean susceptibility and proportion
surviving? Should this be suggested as an alternative to Granich
heterogeneity?

The answer looks like $$\bar s = X^\kappa$$; in Granich terms, something
like $$\beta \propto (1-P)^\kappa$$.
